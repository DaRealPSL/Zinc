# Zinc Language Goals and Philosophy

## Core Language Philosophy

Zinc is a simple yet powerful compiled programming language designed to make coding easy, safe, and enjoyable. By combining explicit typing with intuitive syntax and a rich feature set including object-oriented programming and modularity, Zinc targets beginners and seasoned developers alike.

Its design balances readability, performance, and future extensibility, making it a perfect language for learning, scripting, and building real-world applications.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Beginner-Friendly & Intuitive
- Syntax inspired by familiar languages like **JavaScript** and **C++** to reduce learning curve.
- Explicit typing by default, with support for type inference to keep code concise.
- Clear and consistent rules that avoid ambiguity and complexity.

### 2. Lightweight and Performant
- Compiled language aiming for fast compilation and execution.
- Simple toolchain design for quick builds.
- Minimal runtime dependencies to keep executables small and fast.

### 3. Expressive and Robust
- Support for modern programming constructs: classes, functions, modules.
- Safety features like constants and type checking.
- Built-in standard library covering common tasks.

### 4. Modularity and Extensibility
- Strong modular import system to organize code cleanly.
- Tooling ecosystem (formatter, linter, docs) designed to grow with the language.
- Designed with bootstrapping in mind â€” ability to write the compiler in Zinc itself eventually.

### 5. Clear Error Reporting
- Informative syntax and semantic error messages to help developers debug.
- Line and column tracking throughout compilation phases.
